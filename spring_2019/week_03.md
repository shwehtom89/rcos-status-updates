## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Implemented feature called to show new posts in forum
> If a post was edited/added to a thread after the user has last interacted then it is marked new
> Altered database behavior to now update to most recent time a user opens a thread
> Demo'd to team showing posts that are new

## This Week's Plan

> Request Andrew to review my PR
> Make the tooltips a seperate PR (don't add all featres to 1 pr) 
> Work on displaying inline images in the forum for Barb's graphics class

## Anything Blocking?

> Not sure how to display inline images still new to HTML + JS
> Unsure on how to go about splitting my PR

## Notes

> Check out my commits here!  https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/3268
