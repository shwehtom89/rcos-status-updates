## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Requested Andrew to review my PR about filtering unread posts
> Made a seperate PR for added tooltips to forum icons
> Demo'd a more refined version of how new posts should look (had mixed review from team)

## This Week's Plan

> Come up with more mockups on how new posts should look on the forum
> Resolve merge conflicts with my PR's, have not update with master branch
> Make any requested changes that Andrew suggests on his PR

## Anything Blocking?

> Do not know how to resolve merge conflicts without breaking functionality of forum
