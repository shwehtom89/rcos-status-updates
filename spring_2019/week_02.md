## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I worked on my first PR to filter unread posts
> I added a checkbox for the user to select in the filter menu
> edited a database query to check for threads that the user has not interacted with
> Changed database behavior to log everytime a user opens a thread
> added tooltips to forum icons

## This Week's Plan

> Ask for feedback from the rest of the submitty team
> Ask if we want to log every time the user interacts with forum or keep track of most recent visit
> Clean up messy query and rest of js/html for a PR
> Maybe keep track
> Port the forum from generating html to php's twig templating for the view

## Anything Blocking?

> Not what is going wrong with the Tracis.cl e2e tests
