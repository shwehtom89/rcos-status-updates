## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Fixed bug on allowing mentors to edit posts, it did not work previously :)
> Gave mentors more acces to the forum actions
> Buster gave feedback on grades to be release, proposed creating a new row on the navigation page
> Barb made decision not to make a new row, not practical, needs to write tests for a small feature 


## This Week's Plan

> Fix grades to be released button to just change text inbetween grades due and grades available
> Test mentor access to the forum 


## Anything Blocking?

> Nope, not this week
