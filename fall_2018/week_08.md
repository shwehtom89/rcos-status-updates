## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Commented/Documented excel reading code 
> Attempted to integrate it with the shuttletracker with a Cobra command, got basic printing to work

## This Week's Plan

> Finish the Cobra command 
> Look into downloading files from a link instead of hardcoding an
excel file
> Talk with the frontend team for any changes to the json file 
> Figure out how to commit to a branch

## Anything Blocking?

Still need to talk with the frontend group and figure out what they 
want from the database 
Need to research libraries for downloading file
