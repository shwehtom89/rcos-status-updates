## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I was able to set up the shuttle tracker and get it running on my
machine.
> I also able to look at a previously made go script that read data from
an excell spreadsheet and parsed it into a json format

## This Week's Plan

> Look at the school's original excell spread sheet and figure out a way to parse
this data
> Doing something like this would allow us to update the schedule based on changes
made by the school

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to get familiar with go and PostGreSQL
> I need the excell sheet that the administration uses for shuttle data


## Notes

> N/A
