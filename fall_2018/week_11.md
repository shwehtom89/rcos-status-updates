## Semester reflection

Over the course of this semester I learned how to use many different aspects about the software developnemnt tools. I learned how
to better use git and push and pull from different branches. I learned about the language Go and how it handles packages and files. I learned
how to import 3rd party packages into our project and I learned how to seek out help from my teamates. 

Although I was not able to make a full pull request, I feel my contributions would be important for certain features yet to come.

## Notes

My commits were all stashed on my local computer. I also had to switch
computers throughout the semester and in the midst of it I forgot to 
push to master.However the commit time stamps should be good.
