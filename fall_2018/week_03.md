## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was able to write a go script to parse data from excel files using a
custom made excel spreadsheet
> Moved to a new library for parsing excel sheets

## This Week's Plan

> Work on a non custom excel sheet to get data off of
> Parsing data into json format with the specified type parameters that my
teammates will decide on when they create the database Schema

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to get familiar with PostGreSQL and json formatting/handling
> Get my hands on the current excel sheet the schedules are created on


## Notes
