## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I started setting up the shuttle tracker onto my machine. However, I was unsuccessful configuring PostGreSQL and need assistance on that.
> In the meantime, I researched on how PostGreSQL databases are set up and drew out a table structure for how we can store data for the shuttle stops and times.
> I also tried making a python script to read data off the school shuttle schedule PDF. However, the data on the pdf was cluttered and hard to parse in a meaningful way.

## This Week's Plan

> Get the shuttle tracker fulling running on my machine
> Learn more about parsing data from a excell sheet in Go
> Work with teamates on inputting data into a postgres database

## Anything Blocking?

> I am unable to configure PostGreSQL on my machine
> I think it is an issue with using WSL with a windows installation of PostGre

## Notes

> N/A
