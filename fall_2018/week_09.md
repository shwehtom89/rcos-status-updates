## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Integrated excel reading code with the shuttle tracker 
> Have Cobra command working for reading schedules 
> Implemented downloading of a file 

## This Week's Plan

> Add more options to Cobra Command 
> Clear out the clutter in the cmd/schedule.go file, attemp to move the code elsewhere 
> Look into adding to the shuttletracker API to allow reading of excel files from anywhere in the project

## Anything Blocking?

> Figure out how the shuttletracker handles API 
> Figure more about how go handles different "classes" or packages
> Discuss with teamembers on how they are implementing the time module
